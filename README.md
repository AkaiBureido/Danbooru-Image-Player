## Danbooru Image slideshow

This is the project I was yearning to do for quite some
time but never actually got myself to start on it.

Puspose of this application if fairly straightforward, set a timer,
set some tags and let the app display a slideshow of images
from Danbooru, Konachan or any other Danbooru API website.

Maybe if I am no going to become coding-lazy I will add a nice image browser,
but for now I'd rather concentrate on making the slideshow work flawlessly,
which it does not really do yet since I suck at Objective-C and Cocoa.
